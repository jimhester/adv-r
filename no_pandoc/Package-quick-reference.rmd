# Quick reference sheet for package process

In progress

All devtools package functions take a package path as the first argument. If it is omitted it assumes the package is in the current working directory - developing the package in this way is best practice.

## Create a new package

* With no R files: `create("mypackage")`

* With R files: copy in to a directory called `R/` and then run `load_all()`

## Development workflow

* Re-loading the package during development: `load_all()` (this loads dependent packages, data, R code and compiled src code)

* Converting roxygen comments to Rd files: `document()`

* Check that in-development documentation looks ok: `dev_help("topic")`

## Deploying

* Locally
* On github
* On CRAN

### Building the package for all users of the system

Change to the path of the package

```R
document()
install()
```
