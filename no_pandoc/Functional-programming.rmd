One use of anonymous functions is to create small functions that it's not worth naming; the other main use of anonymous functions is to create closures, functions written by functions. Closures are so called because they __enclose__ the environment of the parent function, and can access all variables in the parent. This is useful because it allows us to have two levels of parameters. One level of parameters (the parent) controls how the function works; the other level (the child) does the work. The following example shows how we can use this idea to generate a family of power functions. The parent function (`power()`) creates child functions (`square()` and `cube()`) that do the work.

```R
power <- function(exponent) {
  function(x) x ^ exponent
}

square <- power(2)
square(2)
square(4)

cube <- power(3)
cube(2)
cube(4)
```

In R, almost every function is a closure, because all functions remember the environment in which they are created, typically either the global environment, if it's a function that you've written, or a package environment, if it's a function that someone else has written. The only exception are primitive functions, which call to C directly.

When you print a closure, you don't see anything terribly useful:

```R
square
cube
```

That's because the function itself doesn't change; it's the enclosing environment, `environment(square)`, that's different. One way to see the contents of the environment is to convert it to a list:

```R
as.list(environment(square))
as.list(environment(cube))
```

Another way to see what's going on is to use `pryr::unenclose()`, which substitutes the variables defined in the enclosing environment into the original functon:

```R
library(pryr)
unenclose(square)
unenclose(cube)
```

Note that the parent environment of the closure is the environment created when the parent function is called:

```R
power <- function(exponent) {
  print(environment())
  function(x) x ^ exponent
}
zero <- power(0)
environment(zero)
```

This environment normally disappears once the function finishes executing, but because we return a function, the environment is captured and attached to the new function. Each time we re-run `power()` a new environment is created, so each function produced by power is independent.

Closures are useful for making function factories, and are one way to manage mutable state in R. 

### Function factories

We've already seen two example of function factories, `missing_fixer()` and `power()`. In both these cases using a function factory instead of a single function with multiple arguments has little, if any, benefit. Function factories are most useful when:

* the different levels are more complex, with multiple arguments and complicated bodies

* some work only needs to be done once, when the function is generated

INSERT USEFUL EXAMPLE HERE

We'll see another compelling use of function factories when we learn more about [[functionals]]; they are particularly well suited to maximum likelihood problems.

### Mutable state

Having variables at two levels makes it possible to maintain state across function invocations, because while the function environment is refreshed every time, its parent environment stays constant. The key to managing variables at different levels is the double arrow assignment operator (`<<-`). Unlike the usual single arrow assignment (`<-`) that always assigns in the current environment, the double arrow operator will keep looking up the chain of parent environments until it finds a matching name. ([[Environments]] has more details on how it works)

Together, a static parent environment and `<<-` make it possible to maintain state across function calls.  The following example shows a counter that records how many times a function has been called. Each time `new_counter` is run, it creates an environment, initialises the counter `i` in this environment, and then creates a new function.

```R
new_counter <- function() {
  i <- 0
  function() {
    i <<- i + 1
    i
  }
}
```

The new function is a closure, and its enclosing environment is the usually temporary environment created with `new_counter` is run.  When the closures `counter_one` and `counter_two` are run, each one modifies the counter in a different enclosing environment and so maintain different counts. 

```R
counter_one <- new_counter()
counter_two <- new_counter()

counter_one() # -> [1] 1
counter_one() # -> [1] 2
counter_two() # -> [1] 1
```

We can use our environment inspection tools to see what's going on here:

```R
as.list(environment(counter_one))
as.list(environment(counter_two))
```

The counters get around the "fresh start" limitation by not modifying variables in their local environment. Since the changes are made in the unchanging parent (or enclosing) environment, they are preserved across function calls.

What happens if we don't use a closure? What happens if we only use `<-` instead of `<<-`? Make predictions about what will happen if you replace `new_counter()` with each variant below, then run the code and check your predictions.

```R
i <- 0
new_counter2 <- function() {
  i <<- i + 1
  i
}
new_counter3 <- function() {
  i <- 0
  function() {
    i <- i + 1
    i
  }
}
```

Modifying values in a parent environment is an important technique because it is one way to generate "mutable state" in R. Mutable state is normally hard to achieve, because every time it looks like you're modifying an object, you're actually creating a copy and modifying that. That said, if you do need mutable objects, except in the simplest of cases, it's usually better to use the [[R5]] OO system. R5 objects are easier to document, and provide easier ways to inherit behaviour.

The power of closures is tightly coupled to [[functionals]] and [[function operators]], and you'll see many more examples of closures in those two chapters.  The following section disucsses the remaining important property of functions: the ability to store them in a list.

### Exercises

* What does the following statistical function do? What would be a better name for it? (The existing name is a bit of a hint)

    ```R
    bc <- function(lambda) {
      if (lambda == 0) {
        function(x) log(x)
      } else {
        function(x) (x ^ lambda - 1) / lambda
      }
    }
    ```

* Create a function that creates functions that compute the ith [central moment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_moment) of a numeric vector. You can test it by running the following code:

    ```R
    m1 <- moment(1)
    m2 <- moment(2)

    x <- runif(m1, 100)
    stopifnot(all.equal(m1(x), mean(x)))
    stopifnot(all.equal(m2(x), var(x) * 99 / 100))
    ```

* What does `approxfun()` do? What does it return? 

* What does the `ecdf()` function do? What does it return? 

* Create a function `pick()`, that takes an index, `i`, as an argument and returns a function an argument `x` that subsets `x` with `i`.
  
    ```R
    lapply(mtcars, pick(5))
    # should do the same this as
    lapply(mtcars, function(x) x[[5]])
    ```

## Lists of functions

In R, functions can be stored in lists. Instead of giving a set of functions related names, you can store them in a list.  This makes it easier to work with groups of related functions, in the same way a data frame makes it easier to work with groups of related vectors.

We'll start with a simple example: benchmarking, when you are comparing the performance of multiple approaches to the same problem. For example, if you wanted to compare a few approaches to computing the mean, you could store each approach (function) in a list:

```R
compute_mean <- list(
  base = function(x) mean(x),
  sum = function(x) sum(x) / length(x),
  manual = function(x) {
    total <- 0
    n <- length(x)
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
      total <- total + x[i] / n
    }
    total
  }
)
```

Calling a function from a list is straightforward: just get it out of the list first:

```R
x <- runif(1e5)
system.time(compute_mean$base(x))
system.time(compute_mean[[2]](x))
system.time(compute_mean[["manual"]](x))
```

If we want to call each functions to check that we've implemented them correctly and they return the same answer, we can use `lapply()`, either with an anonymous function, or an equivalent named function.

```R
lapply(compute_mean, function(f, ...) f(...), x)

call_fun <- function(f, ...) f(...)
lapply(compute_mean, call_fun, x)
```

If we want to time how long each function takes, we can combine lapply with `system.time()`:

```R
lapply(compute_mean, function(f) system.time(f(x)))
```
    
Coming back to our original motivating example, another use case of lists of functions is summarising an object in multiple ways. We could store each summary function in a list, and then run them all with `lapply()`:

```R
funs <- list(
  sum = sum,
  mean = mean,
  median = median
)
lapply(funs, function(f) f(1:10))
```

What if we wanted our summary functions to automatically remove missing values?  One approach would be make a list of anonymous functions that call our summary functions with the appropriate arguments:

```R
funs2 <- list(
  sum = function(x, ...) sum(x, ..., na.rm = TRUE),
  mean = function(x, ...) mean(x, ..., na.rm = TRUE),
  median = function(x, ...) median(x, ..., na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

But this leads to a lot of duplication - each function is almost identical apart from a different function name. We could write a closure to abstract this away:

Instead, we could modify our original `lapply()` call:

```R
lapply(funs, function(f) f(x))
lapply(funs, function(f) f(x, na.rm = TRUE))

# Or use a named function instead of an anonymous function
remove_missings <- function(f) {
  function(...) f(..., na.rm = TRUE)
}
funs2 <- lapply(funs, remove_missings)
```

### Moving lists of functions to the global environment

From time to time you may want to create a list of functions that you want to be available to your users without having to use a special syntax. For a simple example, imagine you want to make it easy to create HTML with code, by mapping each html tag to an R function. The following simple example creates functions for `<p>` (paragraphics), `<b>` (bold), `<i>` (italics), and `<img>` (images).  Note the use of a closure function factory to produce the text for `<p>`, `<b>` and `<i>` tags.

```R
simple_tag <- function(tag) {
  function(...) paste0("<", tag, ">", paste0(...), "</", tag, ">")
}
html <- list(
  p = simple_tag("p"),
  b = simple_tag("b"),
  i = simple_tag("i"),
  img = function(path, width, height) {
    paste0("<img src='", path, "' width='", width, "' height = '", height, '" />')
  }
)
```

We store the functions in a list because we don't want them to be available all the time: the risk of a conflict between an existing R function and an HTML tag is high. However, keeping them in a list means that our code is more verbose than necessary:

```R
html$p("This is ", html$b("bold"), ", ", html$i("italic"), " and ",
   html$b(html$i("bold italic")), " text")
```

We have three options to eliminate the use of `html$`, depending on how long we want the effect to last:

* For a very temporary effect, we can use a `with()` block:

    ```R
    with(html, p("This is ", b("bold"), ", ", i("italic"), " and ",
      b(i("bold italic")), " text"))
    ```

* For a longer effect, we can use `attach()` to add the functions in `html` in to the search path.  It's possible to undo this action using `detach`:

    ```R
    attach(html)
    p("This is ", b("bold"), ", ", i("italic"), " and ",
      b(i("bold italic")), " text")
    detach(html)
    ```

* Finally, we could copy the functions into the global environment with `list2env()`.  We can undo this action by deleting the functions after we're done.
  
    ```R
    list2env(html, environment())
    p("This is ", b("bold"), ", ", i("italic"), " and ",
      b(i("bold italic")), " text")
    rm(list = names(html), envir = environment())
    ```

I recommend the first option because it makes it very clear what's going on, and when code is being executed in a special context.

### Exercises

* Implement a summary function that works like `base::summary()`, but takes a list of functions to use to compute the summary. Modify the function so it returns a closure, making it possible to use it as a function factory.

* Create a named list of all base functions.  Use `ls()`, `get()` and `is.function()`. Use that list of functions to answer the following questions:

    * Which base function has the most arguments? 
    * How many base functions have no arguments?

* Which of the following commands is `with(x, f(z))` equivalent to?

    (a) `x$f(x$z)`
    (b) `f(x$z)`
    (c) `x$f(z)`
    (d) `f(z)`

## Case study: numerical integration

To conclude this chapter, we will develop a simple numerical integration tool, and along the way, illustrate the use of many properties of first-class functions. Each step is driven by a desire to make our approach more general and to reduce duplication.  The idea behind numerical integration is simple: we want to find the area under the curve by approximating a complex curve with simpler components.

The two simpliest approaches are the __midpoint__ and __trapezoid__ rules; the mid point rule approximates a curve by a rectangle, and the trapezoid rule by a trapezoid. Each takes a function we want to integrate, `f`, and a range to integrate over, from `a` to `b`. For this example we'll try to integrate `sin x` from 0 to pi, because it has a simple answer: 2.

```R
midpoint <- function(f, a, b) {
  (b - a) * f((a + b) / 2)
}

trapezoid <- function(f, a, b) {
  (b - a) / 2 * (f(a) + f(b))
}

midpoint(sin, 0, pi)
trapezoid(sin, 0, pi)
```

Neither of these functions gives a very good approximation, so we'll do what we normally do in calculus: break up the range into smaller pieces and integrate each piece using one of the simple rules. This is called __composite integration__, and we'll implement it with two new functions:

```R
midpoint_composite <- function(f, a, b, n = 10) {
  points <- seq(a, b, length = n + 1)
  h <- (b - a) / n
  
  area <- 0
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    area <- area + h * f((points[i] + points[i + 1]) / 2)
  }
  area
}

trapezoid_composite <- function(f, a, b, n = 10) {
  points <- seq(a, b, length = n + 1)
  h <- (b - a) / n
  
  area <- 0
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    area <- area + h / 2 * (f(points[i]) + f(points[i + 1]))
  }
  area
}

midpoint_composite(sin, 0, pi, n = 10)
midpoint_composite(sin, 0, pi, n = 100)
trapezoid_composite(sin, 0, pi, n = 10)
trapezoid_composite(sin, 0, pi, n = 100)
    
mid <- sapply(1:20, function(n) midpoint_composite(sin, 0, pi, n))
trap <- sapply(1:20, function(n) trapezoid_composite(sin, 0, pi, n))
matplot(cbind(mid = mid, trap))
```

But notice that there's a lot of duplication across `midpoint_composite` and `trapezoid_composite`: they are basically the same apart from the internal rule used to integrate over a simple range. Let's extract out a general composite integrate function:

```R
composite <- function(f, a, b, n = 10, rule) {
  points <- seq(a, b, length = n + 1)
  
  area <- 0
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    area <- area + rule(f, points[i], points[i + 1])
  }
  
  area
}

midpoint_composite(sin, 0, pi, n = 10)
composite(sin, 0, pi, n = 10, rule = midpoint)
composite(sin, 0, pi, n = 10, rule = trapezoid)
```

This function now takes two functions as arguments: the function to integrate, and the integration rule to use for simple ranges. We can now add even better rules for integrating small ranges:

```R
simpson <- function(f, a, b) {
  (b - a) / 6 * (f(a) + 4 * f((a + b) / 2) + f(b))
}

boole <- function(f, a, b) {
  pos <- function(i) a + i * (b - a) / 4
  fi <- function(i) f(pos(i))
  
  (b - a) / 90 * 
    (7 * fi(0) + 32 * fi(1) + 12 * fi(2) + 32 * fi(3) + 7 * fi(4))
}
```
    
Let's compare these different approaches.

```R
expt1 <- expand.grid(
  n = 5:50, 
  rule = c("midpoint", "trapezoid", "simpson", "boole"), 
  stringsAsFactors = F)

abs_sin <- function(x) abs(sin(x))
run_expt <- function(n, rule) {
  composite(abs_sin, 0, 4 * pi, n = n, rule = match.fun(rule))
}

library(plyr)
res1 <- mdply(expt1, run_expt)

library(ggplot2)
qplot(n, V1, data = res1, colour = rule, geom = "line")
```

It turns out that the midpoint, trapezoid, Simpson and Boole rules are all examples of a more general family called Newton-Cotes rules. (They are polynomials of increasing complexity).  We can take our integration one step further by extracting out this commonality to produce a function that can generate any general Newton-Cotes rule:

```R
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas
newton_cotes <- function(coef, open = FALSE) {
  n <- length(coef) + open
  
  function(f, a, b) {
    pos <- function(i) a + i * (b - a) / n
    points <- pos(seq.int(0, length(coef) - 1))
    
    (b - a) / sum(coef) * sum(f(points) * coef)        
  }
}

trapezoid <- newton_cotes(c(1, 1))
midpoint <- newton_cotes(1, open = TRUE)
simpson <- newton_cotes(c(1, 4, 1))
boole <- newton_cotes(c(7, 32, 12, 32, 7))
milne <- newton_cotes(c(2, -1, 2), open = TRUE)

expt1 <- expand.grid(n = 5:50, rule = names(rules), 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
run_expt <- function(n, rule) {
  composite(abs_sin, 0, 4 * pi, n = n, rule = rules[[rule]])
}
```

Mathematically, the next step in improving numerical integration is to move from a grid of evenly spaced points to a grid where the points are closer together near the end of the range, such as __Gaussian quadrature__.  That's beyond the scope of this case study, but you would use similar techniques to add it.

### Exercises

* Instead of creating individual fuctions `midpoint()`, `trapezoid()`, `simpson()` etc, we could store them in a list. If we do that, how does the code change? Can you create the list of functions from a list of coefficients for the Newton-Cotes formulae?

* The tradeoff in integration rules is that more complex rules are slower to compute, but need fewer pieces.  For `sin()` in the range [0, pi], determine the number of pieces needed to for each rule to be equally accurate. Illustrate your results with a graph.  How do they change for different functions? `sin(1 / x^2)` is particularly challenging. 

*  For each of the Newton-Cotes rules, how many pieces do you need to get within 0.1% of the true answer for `sin()` in the range [0, pi].  Write a function that determines that automatically for any function (hint: look at `optim()` and construct a one-argument function with closures)
